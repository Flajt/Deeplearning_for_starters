    "You use it in photo editing, in apps(Snapchat's filters for example, that makes you look like a dog or whatever else), in your Google search (the recommendations that google is showing you) or in advertisment (like Amazon:\"The people who bought this product also bought...\"). So as you see Machine Learning is everywere and why don't use it aswell. Or in image classification (this is a dog and this and this not...) and more. "

    "So as we humans often do, we looked around in nature and find\n",
    "a powerfull \"device\" to work with data. It's called \"Brain\"; so the brain is learning\n",
    "by exprience. In detail our brain is working with neurons (so were do you think the name: \"Neuronal Network\" is from?), a neuron is a nerv that taking an input and returning an output if a certain point is reached (the neuron is \"fireing\"). So for example if we see a dog our eyes send the image via an electronic signal to the brain. There these image will be inputed into a neuron, this is connected with several other ones, so the neuron can see a dog with 95% probability, an cat with 2% probability and a wolf with 3% probability. So it sends these output to another neurons with a nerve called \"synapse\" if a neuron is using one synapes more then others these will became stronger. The other neurons are getting the image pluse the probability of the neuron from before"
